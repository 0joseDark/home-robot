Platform-agnostic control code that
1. Consumes / logs sensor data
2. Computes action commands

TODO migrate here:
- Control stack in `fairo/droidlet/lowlevel`
    - Austin's velocity control logic in 
    - SLAM & odom localization services
    - Planning services (map builder, FMMPlanner)
- Most of cpaxton/home_robot
